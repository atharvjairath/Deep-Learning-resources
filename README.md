# Deep-Learning-resources
Hi,
So I created this Deep-Learning Resource guide to keep a track of my learning as well as to share those resoruces with others.
Please feel free to add your resources as well.
Happy learning!

## Machine Learning
Deep Learning is an important subset of Machine Learning and it is therefor important to get a wider knowledge and understanding of Machine Learning. The Coursera Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng is highly recommended.

There are other very amazing coureses on both Coursera and Udacity. But you can also go through one of the best playlist available.
